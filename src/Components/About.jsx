          <b className="name">Skyler</b> is an advanced IoT-powered robot designed to perform an
          extensive variety of pre-defined actions and gestures, making it an
          engaging, highly interactive, and multifunctional companion. With its
          state-of-the-art motion capabilities and intuitive programming, Skyler
          can greet you with a friendly &quot;Hello&quot;, shake hands, and execute a wide
          range of arm movements, such as raising or lowering individual hands
          or both hands simultaneously. It can also perform strength-related
          poses like right biceps, left biceps, and double biceps to demonstrate
          power, while engaging in dynamic and entertaining actions such as
          bowing, performing karate moves, ape-like gestures, dabbing, and side
          bends. Beyond entertainment, Skyler is equipped to demonstrate
          exercises, adjust its posture by sitting down or standing up, and
          navigate its environment by turning, moving forward or backward, and
          picking up objects with accuracy and care. Skylerâ€™s precision and
          adaptability are further enhanced by its ability to speak pre-defined
          words, allowing it to respond, assist, and engage in conversations.
          Whether used for educational purposes, assistance in various tasks,
          interactive entertainment, or as a showcase for IoT and robotics
          technology, Skyler blends cutting-edge innovation with practicality to
          create a seamless, interactive experience for users. Its capabilities
          not only highlight its potential for personal use but also make it an
          ideal tool for integration into smart environments and future
          applications in robotics and automation.
